## Seattle Covid19

# Introduction: Business Problem
- Since the beginning of 2020, Seattle and many other cities around the world have been under attack by an invisible army called ‘Novel Corona Virus’, also known as ‘Covid-19’. Every effort has been focusing on solving or minimizing problems, including Data Scientists. Data Scientists assessed the situations in places around the world, such as availability, amount, and geographical distribution (i.e. locations) of health infrastructures, such as virus testing centers and authorized hospitals to treat affected patients. In this article, we would like to present a simple analysis for determining strategic locations for the distribution of masks and medical devices for COVID-19 treatment, based on confirmed cases on April 1, 2021, and the red zone areas for “new normal” condition analysis.

# Data
- A few Identified factors that influence our decision are:
- Covid-19 cases per district “Seattle”
- Total population in Seattle
- 10 most population in Seattle 
- Hospital for treatment covid-19 

### The following data sources are needed to extract/generate the required information:
- Processed covid-19 positive case data collection on 1 April 2021.
- The distribution of mask sales based on the population in the Seattle area.
- The distribution of mask sales based on 5 districts with the most densely populated populations.
- New datasets (to be created) from Hospital table that contains city, district, along with their latitudes and longitudes.
